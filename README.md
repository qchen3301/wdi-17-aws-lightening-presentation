screenshots and a very, very brief intro to AWS

AWS - Amazon Web Service

Amazon Web Service is a cloud-based digital suite that provides hosting, server space and development options for businesses. 

AWS, like its competition from Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, etc. is a scalable service. A flat, tiered subscription opens the paywall to its services, but the additional cost of those services depends on use. 

Currently the AWS platform leads its competitors by a wide, wide margin margin.

The four screenshots are from my AWS account. Amazon offers one year of AWS free on sign up. Screenshots 1 through 3 show what the browser menu looks like when intializing an instance of a Linux virtual machine - basically a Linux computer you can access through AWS, remotely. The fourth screenshot shows a menu more applicable to our class: virtual programs (sort of like the pseudo-program we use to complete Codeacademy exercises) to build programs in Python, Javascript, etc.
