AWS - Amazon Web Service

Amazon Web Service is a cloud-based digital suite that provides hosting, server space and development options for businesses. 

AWS, like its competition from Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, etc. is a scalable service. A flat, tiered subscription opens the paywall to its services, but the additional cost of those services depends on use. 

Currently the AWS platform leads its competitors by a wide, wide margin margin.
